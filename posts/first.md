As far as debuts go, this is a bloody impressive one! Carrie is a horror novel that uses it slow pace to draw you in. This slower pace essentially slows down the horror, Carrie’s hell at home, and Carrie’s hell at school, I guess you could call Carrie an anti-hero, because King’s storytelling really does have you offering her your sympathies, hoping for a revenge plot.

I was worried about reading this novel as I’ve watched the movies and I remember the most recent one very well, but despite knowing the events that would occur in this novel, I still greatly enjoyed it. And I’m sure Constant Readers will agree with me, this was the birth of ‘the shine’ – the abilities that are so prevalent in King’s novels. In Carrie, it takes the form of telekinesis. It’s interesting because the blurb clearly states Carrie has this gift so the suspense is there from the first page, wondering when and where Carrie will first use her ability, will it be intentional or accidental, will it be to help or to harm?

From his very first novel, King mastered writing unlikeable characters; it’s a raging success when a reader actively dislikes certain characters with a passion, it shows how well-crafted the character is.

At under 300 pages, this novel is perfect for people wanting to read a King novel, but don’t want to read a book of 500+ pages. This shorter novel gives you a glimpse in to the darker imagination of King, the horror and the brilliant storytelling. This is a King I definitely recommend, and I’m looking forward to continuing reading my way through all his books.
