This book came highly recommended to me by many and I’m not sure if I should thank those that recommended it or curse them out…as this book was terrifying, bloody terrifying!

Malerman created such a creepy atmosphere; the tension was unbearable, I was looking over my shoulder this entire read, although I couldn’t tell you exactly what I was looking out for. The synopsis doesn’t give much away and I won’t either. But take a look at the book cover, imagine not being able to open your eyes but knowing you’re not safe because ‘they’ are coming for you. Some reviews for this book will give you details about what happens if you look outside and what’s coming for you, but I think this will be a much more enjoyable read if you dive in head first, discovering these disturbing things as you go along.

There’s a nice range of characters in this story, some you grow to love and some you grow to hate.

Some people have mentioned they weren’t overly satisfied with the way the book ended but I didn’t see a problem with it. I think as an author, it must be a hard task to know you’ve written something quite special and then have to come up with an ending that doesn’t disappoint. I cannot fault this book, Malerman has written a superb novel that will play with your mind long after finishing it.

Upon reflection, starting this book at midnight was not one of my smartest decisions, this book had me imagining all kinds of crazy scenarios…as someone who likes to overthink things and has a very active imagination, ‘my mind has no ceiling’, I believed ‘they’ were really out there and ‘they’ were coming for me…
