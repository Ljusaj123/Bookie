I’m afraid this won’t be a glowing review, Do Not Become Alarmed was not the book for me. The above blurb is accurate until it states: “what follows is a heart-racing story told….” – my heart did not race at all, in fact, I was worried it would flat-line, I think that clarifies my enjoyment levels for this read.

My issue wasn’t with the storyline as such, the kidnapping that occurred was believable. My issue was more the delivery – the theme didn’t come through at all, in what should have been a character-driven story that showcased how the parents acted in the aftermath of their children going missing, for me, it completely missed the mark. I’m sorry to say it all felt rather bland, no themes of maternal anxiety, no thrills, no emotion whatsoever.

It didn’t help that I did not like any of the main characters, I took a particular disliking to the parents, I didn’t feel any of their grief. Nora, in particular, appeared over-dramatic in her actions and it got to the point of annoyance. Everyone likes kids right, nope, not in this one, even the actions of the kids annoyed me, it just all felt forced. I felt like the character’s action were written to give this novel the thrill-factor rather than to craft believeable actions but it just didn’t happen. Of all the characters, I did like Oscar for the short time he was in the story, and that’s most likely because he wasn’t a main character so I was somewhat intrigued by his actions and how he coped with the situation he found himself in. But other than that, this novel gave me nothing!

I know I’m being harsh in my review but I have to be honest, I would not recommend this book. The pace was terribly slow, the parent’s grief seemed forced, for the majority of the novel it felt as if nothing was happening. I buddy read this book with Sam @ Clues and Reviews, I was several chapters ahead of her throughout the read and our conversation throughout went something like this:

Sam: Does it get better? // Me: Not really, I’m hoping for something to happen soon. // Sam: Does it get better? // Me: Nothing happening yet. // Sam: Does it get better? // Me: No // Sam: Should I skim read the rest? // Me: I think that would be for the best!

They say “no two people read the same book” so if you’ve got this one on your TBR, I hope you have better luck than me.
