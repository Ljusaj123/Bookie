Now You See is a thrilling read, with its short chapters, this plot moves at a fast-pace; you’re instantly hooked – this is the perfect novel for a one-sitting read! Very early on we hear the voice of the killer, hearing this perspective so early on immediately ups the ante because you see no feelings of guilt or remorse, so you just know, there are more murders to follow. These snippets from the killer feature throughout the book, and I can confirm, inside the mind of a serial killer is a chilling, yet disturbingly thrilling, place to be!

I really liked the way Manning incorporated the murders taking place into the plot. Using just a page or two to describe a murder really added to the tension, as it’s a reflection of the killer – quick, succinct but with a lasting effect. In the age of social media, a murder can take place in a secluded location with no witnesses, yet it gives the killer the anonymity to broadcast their actions to the world. I, Killer loves the spotlight, and the only way to stay in the spotlight is to keep on killing!

The portrayal of DCI Fenton is a very realistic one, but be careful when you call out a killer, because he just might answer! Alongside DCI Fenton, we have Blake, the ex-boyfriend of the first victim, who, for me, was the best character. From a background of investigative journalism, Blake is haunted by his past, and we get to know a bit about his history and why he is the way he is. While this is DCI Dan Fenton’s series, I really hope this is not the last we see of Blake.

Due to Blake’s large role in this plot, Now You See isn’t your typical police procedural. While it follows the format, I think it extends beyond being an ideal read for fans of this subgenre of crime fiction, but the perfect read for anyone who enjoys a pacey serial killer thriller.

My only small, and I mean small, misgiving with this plot was one particular move by the killer had everyone confused, but I thought it was incredibly obvious what was meant by the action. However, that may come from me living and breathing mysteries. Regardless, Now You See is a fantastic first instalment in what I’m sure will become a thrilling series. So, don’t miss out, grab yourself a copy of this novel and let Manning, by way of I, Killer, chill and thrill you!
